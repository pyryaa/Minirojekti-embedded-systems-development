## RPi Webserver

In Windows Powershell:

Raspberry pi based webserver can be started with the command ``venv\Scripts\activate`` in the ``testing/RPi/test`` folder. After this a virtual environment starts. We will next start the server by going to the folder ``RPi`` and running ``python wserver.py`` this will start the server, and show the ip address for accessing it. 

The server shows statistics of all the sessions stored on RPi. This can be changed from the ``RPi\templates\home.html`` document.
